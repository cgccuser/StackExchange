# StackExchange

Disclaimer: This has nothing to do with the network of Q&A sites that is also called Stack Exchange.

Stack Exchange is a stack-based language that involves exchanging stacks.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/ysthakur/StackExchange/wiki) for more info.

## Installation:

You probably don't want to install this, but anyway, if you need to:
- Click on the latest green workflow [here](https://github.com/cgccuser/StackExchange/actions/workflows/makejar.yml)
- Scroll down to the artifacts section and download the thing saying `stackexchange`
- For whatever reason, it's a zip file, so extract `StackExchange.jar` from that
- Run the jar using `java -jar StackExchange.jar "program" "input1" "input2" "input*"
